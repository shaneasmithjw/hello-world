# hello-world
Just testing for now.  Newbie.

Desktop Administrator for ASC Profiles - been involved in the IT field for 25 years and in the computer field as a hobby for about 35 years.  My only programming experience is with BASIC and writing very simple scripts in Windows.

Very interested in Raspberry Pi and trying to learn as much as possible about SBCs, in general.  I can see some serious potential working with SBCs and have seen a number of projects, thus far, that I would like to tackle.
